## Latest SDK News
1.  Starting from 5.2.41727.0928, the Windows SDK requires building with Visual Studio 2019.
2. Starting from Client SDK 5.0, if you are using tokens to start a meeting, you will only need to retrieve ZAK from Zoom API. The user token has been deprecated. 
3. To follow with Zoom client's recent changes, Zoom SDK has temporary remove the "Unmute All" interface in Client SDK 5.0.
4. To align with Zoom’s [recent announcement](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/22/zoom-hits-milestone-on-90-day-security-plan-releases-zoom-5-0/) pertaining to our security initiative, Zoom Client SDKs have added **AES 256-bit GCM encryption** support, which provides more protection for meeting data and greater resistance to tampering. **The system-wide account enablement of AES 256-bit GCM encryption will take place on June 01, 2020.** You are **strongly recommended** to start the required upgrade to this latest version 4.6.21666.0428 at your earliest convenience.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
* For detailed instructions, please refer to our documentation website: [https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/native-sdks/windows/c-sharp-wrapper](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/native-sdks/windows/c-sharp-wrapper);
* If you need support or assistance, please visit our [Zoom Developer Community Forum](https://devforum.zoom.us/);

### Prerequisites

* **A Zoom Account**: If you do not have one, you can sign up at [https://zoom.us/signup](https://zoom.us/signup).
  * Once you have your Zoom Account, sign up for a 60-days free trial at [https://marketplace.zoom.us/](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
* **A device with Windows OS**:
  * OS: Windows XP or later. Currently Windows 10 UWP is not supported.
  * CPU: Zoom C# wrapper currently only supports x86
  * Visual Studio 2019


### Installing

└── zoom_sdk_demo
```
Please follow the below steps to get started:

1.The wrap `Dll` locate at `zoom_sdk_csharp_wrap_github\bin\zoom_sdk_dotnet_wrap.dll`.

2.Run the demo project,

a>`zoom_sdk_csharp_wrap_github\zoom_sdk_demo\zoom_sdk_demo.csproj`

b>change vs project's solution configuration to "release"

c>change vs project's solution platform to "x86"

d>build and run.

### Initializing SDK with JWT token
When initializing the SDK, you will need to compose a JWT token using your SDK key & secret.

* How to compose JWT token for SDK initialization

You may generate your JWT token using the online tool https://jwt.io/. **It is highly recommended to generate your JWT token in your backend server.**

JWT is generated with three core parts: Header, Payload, and Signature. When combined, these parts are separated by a period to form a token: aaaaa.bbbbb.cccc.

Please follow this template to compose your payload for SDK initialization:

** Header
```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```
** Payload
```
{
         "appKey": "string",     // Your SDK key
         "iat": long,   // access token issue timestamp (unit: second)
         "exp": long,  // access token expire timestamp, MAX: iat + 2 days (unit: second)
         "tokenExp": long // token expire timestamp, MIN:iat + 30 minutes (unit: second)
}
```
**The minimum value of `tokenExp` should be at least 30 minutes, otherwise, SDK will reject the authentication request.**
** Signature
```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  "Your SDK secret here"
)
```
You do not need to secret base64 encoded your signature. Once the JWT token is generated, please do not reveal it or publish it. **It is highly recommended to handle your SDK key and secret and generate JWT in a backend server to be consumed by your application. Do not generate JWT in a production application.**
